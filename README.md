## how to build
use this command in the root directory to build the code.
./gradlew assembleDebug
this generates the apk in pedoMeter/app/build/outputs/apk/debug
alternatively you can use Android Studio. Use Build > Build Bundles APK > Build apk
this generates the apk at pedoMeter/app/build/intermediates/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
We have attached the compiled apk at the root directory.

## how to use
Hold the phone at chest level, hold the phone lightly and
